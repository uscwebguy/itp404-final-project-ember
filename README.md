ITP 404 Final Project

USC Book Search

Using the USC Schedule of Classes web service, the USC Bookstore required book files (http://www.usc.edu/aux-services/bookstore/booklist/) and the ebay API, I created a simple way to search for books requiered for a course.

First, the user chooses a department from the left hand sidebar. This will populate a list of courses in the body of the page. 

From here, they select a course, which will list all of the sessions for that course.
